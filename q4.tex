    What is the definition of a basic block? 
    Why is there a desire to create larger ones? 
    Give one example of a way to create a bigger basic block.
}{
    A straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit.\pg{149}

    So compilers can optimize more.

    Loop unrolling
}

}{
    What's an example of a commonly occurring indirect branch, and a hardware structure used to deal with it?
}{
    Subroutines / Functions

    Return address stack
}

}{  
    Compilers have trouble optimizing code that involves reads and writes to memory, why?
}{
    Hazard through memory system.

    OR

    Hazards through memory system makes it hard to optimize the code by compiler. 
    Finding dependencies through memory is hard. 
    Compilers can't calculate the physical address at compile time, only hardware knows in runtime.

}{
    Intel uses a Tournament predictor in some of their processors. 
    Describe what it is, and why it is used. 
    Your description can (and probably should) include sketches and drawings.
}{
    Tournament predictor is a meta predictor that predicts which predictor should be used

    It's used because each predictor performs differently based on the situation. 
    For example, 2-bit predictor performs better than G-share when we jump to somewhere new. 
    But after G-share learns, it will perform better.

    What is the definition of a precise interrupt?
    Why it is a challenge in \OOO(OOO) machines?
    The two main techniques used today to provide a precise interrupt?
}{
    When an interrupt happens, every instruction before it has finished and none after can complete.
    
    \todo

    ROB and \todo

    If in addition to completing \OOO, instructions were allowed to issue \OOO, what new data hazard would be introduced.
}{
