    An important program spends 30\% of its time doing memory operations(loads and stores). 
    By redesigning the memory hierarchy you can make the memory operations 80\% faster (take 20\% as long), or you can redesign the hardware to make the rest of the machine 30\% faster (take 70\% as long). 
    Which should you do and why? 
    (You must show your work to get full credit.)
